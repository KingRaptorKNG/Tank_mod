# Tank_mod
A simple, absolutely not scary Minecraft tank mod

Warning: this mod contains loud sounds, paranoia, feeling of being watched, high br War Thunder experience and high explosive projectiles. Proceed with caution!
Survival experience for 10 in-game days is very recommended! If you are putting new version of the mod into the world with older version expect bugs!
!!! GeckoLib required !!!
!!! Version 1.20.1 !!!
This mod is still in beta, bugs may occur, and crashes, if you encountered one of them be sure to make an issue with the log. This will help a lot. If you feel a lot of lag in the game with this mod, be sure to make an issue with your PC specs. This way I may optimise the mod in the future.
